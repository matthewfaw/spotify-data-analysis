# Spotify Data Analysis

I've started logging all my Spotify listening history in mongo.  This is the repo I use
to analyze my listening patterns so that I can have a more diverse music listening 
experience :)

## Installation

Install python requirements by running `pip install -r <Project Root>/requirements.txt`

## The analysis I've set up so far:

- Get the genres of all artists I listen to on Spotify
- Get the related artists for the artists I listen to
- Generate a related artists graph, and use NetworkX/Matplotlib to visualize and understand this graph
